# Ruby Math Game

This Ruby application is a simple command line math game made to teach myself OOP and encapsulation with Ruby. It is course work from [Lighthouse Labs](https://github.com/lighthouse-labs).

After opening the game, players see a text welcome screen and are prompted to enter their names. Each player begins with three lives. A player is presented with a basic math problem. Incorrect answers reduce their lives by one. The last player left standing is the winner.

## Run

`ruby main.rb`
